                Many think that being successful in the field of Cinema is an easy job when one has their ancestral
                roots in
                the industry. Of course, Nepotism has become almost an undeniable fact in film industries nowadays. One
                such
                actor who faced problems because of nepotism is actor Vijay. His father is a famous director S. A.
                Chandrasekhar. His fame has increased to a level that there was a situation when Vijay was known by his
                director father, but now, his father is known by him.


                His full name is Joseph Vijay. He was born on June 22, 1974, at Madras, to veteran Tamil film director
                S. A.
                Chandrasekhar and Shoba Chandrasekhar who is a Carnatic vocalist. He had a sister named Vidhya who died
                at
                the age of 2 due to ill health. After her death, Vijay who was once naughty and talkative became very
                silent. He spent his entire childhood in Chennai and finished his graduation at Loyola college.
